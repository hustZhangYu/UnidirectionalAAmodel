# UnidirectionalAAmodel

This repository contains MATLAB code and data related to the study of unidirectional AAmode, focusing on different localization phenomena such as Scale-Free Localization (SFL) and Anderson Localization (AL). The code implements various numerical calculations and visualization techniques under different boundary conditions, including Generalized Boundary Conditions (GBC).

## Repository Structure

- `Eigenstates_SFL_bd.m` - Computes eigenstates for Scale-Free Localization under boundary conditions.
- `Energylevel_gbc.m` - Computes energy levels under Generalized Boundary Conditions.
- `PlotMosaicME.m` - Generates mosaic plots for visualization.
- `Plot_GBC_AL_closevalue.m` - Plots specific eigenvalues close to a given value under GBC and AL.
- `Sfl_AL_GBC_Spectrum.m` - Computes and visualizes the spectrum for SFL and AL under GBC.

### Data and Figures
The repository contains multiple folders that store data and figures for visualization:
- `AllDataPlot/` - Contains all generated plots.
- `Fig2c1/`, `Fig2c2/`, `Fig2d/` - Store figure data for specific cases.
- `MosaicData/` - Stores mosaic visualization data.
- `fig2a/`, `fig2b/` - Additional figure datasets.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have MATLAB installed.
2. Run the `.m` scripts to compute eigenstates, spectra, and other relevant properties.
3. Use the plotting scripts to visualize the results.
4. Data files in the respective folders provide input/output for further analysis.
